# Snake and Ladder Game

Welcome to the Snake and Ladder game! This is a simple console-based implementation of the classic Snake and Ladder board game using C++.

## Game Rules

1. The game starts when a player rolls a dice and gets a six. The player then places their counter on the starting position of the board.

2. If a player's counter lands at the bottom of a ladder, they can move up to the top of the ladder, skipping some positions.

3. If a player's counter lands on the head of a snake, they must slide down to the bottom of the snake, moving back to a lower position on the board.

4. Players take turns rolling a dice and moving their counters along the board based on the dice roll.

5. The first player to reach or exceed the final position (often 100) wins the game.

## How to Play

1. Compile the `main.cpp` file using a C++ compiler.
